KiCad symbols, footprints, and 3D models for PCB Cupid hardware to integrate into your designs.

# PCB Cupid Hardware Libraries

Welcome to the **PCB Cupid** hardware libraries repository! This repo contains all the necessary resources to help you integrate our PCB designs into your own projects using **KiCad**.

## What’s Inside?

This repository includes:

- **KiCad Symbols**: Ready-to-use symbols for various components.
- **KiCad Footprints**: Precise footprints for all components used in our hardware designs.
- **3D Models**: 3D models of our boards for visual representation within your design environment.

These files are designed to be easily imported into your KiCad projects to help you save time and reduce the possibility of errors while incorporating **PCB Cupid** hardware into your designs.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pcb-cupid-hardware.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the hardware you're working with (e.g., `kicad_symbols/`, `kicad_footprints/`, `kicad_3d_models/`).

3. Import the relevant files into your KiCad project:
    - **Symbols**: Use the `Add Footprint` tool to import the symbols into your schematic.
    - **Footprints**: In the **Footprint Editor**, import the necessary footprints.
    - **3D Models**: Attach 3D models to footprints via KiCad's **Footprint Properties**.
